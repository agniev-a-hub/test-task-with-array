Operation Test:

Attached is a file containing over 5000 first names.

Begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical

value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to

obtain a name score.

For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is
worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would

obtain a score of 938 × 53 = 49714.

What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
